# Vinca Wealth

Vinca Wealth helps you stress-test retirement readiness. It focuses on real-life survivability, not best-case returns. Complex trade-offs are converted into clear actions you can take today.

## Why Vinca Wealth Exists

People often feel confident because a corpus “looks big.” Inflation, rising withdrawals, early-retirement gaps, and shocks can still break the plan. Most tools don’t show when money actually runs out; Vinca Wealth does.

## Core Features (Recent Additions)

# FEATURE 1 — Financial Readiness Calculator (with FIRE realism)

## 1. Financial Readiness Calculator (FIRE-based Retirement Readiness)

### What problem it solves
- Users don’t know if they can retire early, retire safely, or retire at all.
- They confuse “corpus at 60” with “corpus that survives until 85+.”

### What the user inputs
- Current age
- Monthly investment (SIP)
- Money already saved
- Retirement age goal
- Expected monthly expenses
- Inflation assumption
- Return assumption
- Life expectancy

### What the dashboard tells the user (Key outputs)
- ✅ Financial Readiness Age: the first age when the plan becomes survivable.
- ✅ Required Corpus vs Expected Corpus: gap to close before the plan is durable.
- ✅ SIP Adjustment Required: how much to raise monthly investing to stay on track.
- ✅ Retirement survivability window: how long the plan lasts (to 85/90).

### Key insights the user gets
- Retiring before 60 needs extra buffer because the runway is longer.
- Longer retirement duration magnifies risk; compounding must outlast withdrawals.
- Corpus alone is meaningless unless it survives withdrawals over decades.

#### Graphs & What They Mean
- Corpus growth curve till retirement: shows how savings and returns build the corpus; a flat or shallow slope signals underfunding.
- Corpus depletion curve after retirement: tracks how fast money is drawn down; a sharp drop signals breakage risk.
- Baseline vs improved SIP comparison: two lines show current path vs boosted contributions; the “danger zone” is where the baseline line hits zero before target age.
- How to respond: raise SIP, delay retirement, or trim expenses until the baseline line clears the target age.

### Action the user takes
✅ Next steps:
- Increase SIP by the suggested amount.
- Delay retirement by the recommended years if the plan still breaks.
- Reduce expenses to shrink withdrawal pressure.

# FEATURE 3 — Health Stress Test (Freemium vs Premium value clearly)

## 3. Health Stress Test (Retirement Plan Under Medical Pressure)

### What problem it solves
- Medical costs are the most ignored retirement risk.
- A plan can look “ready” until health costs arrive.
- Even manageable monthly costs reduce compounding over decades.

### User Flow (Step-by-step)
1) Pick a health stress category: Everyday Care, Planned Procedures, or High Impact Event.
2) Freemium view shows general impact.
3) Premium view shows personalized impact on the user’s actual plan.

## Freemium Section: Educational Preview

### What it teaches
- How health stress changes retirement outcomes.
- Why understanding risk comes before optimization.

### What the cards mean
- Withdrawal Pressure: health costs force higher monthly withdrawals.
- Corpus Drain: extra costs erode long-term compounding.
- Inflation Shock: medical costs typically outpace general inflation.

### Freemium Graphs & what they teach
- Medical cost growth trend: shows medical inflation; steeper lines mean faster erosion of purchasing power.
- Medical cost vs retirement withdrawal pressure: rising health costs push monthly withdrawals higher; widening gaps signal strain.
- Health event vs regular spending comparison: spikes show one-time shocks compared to routine spending.
- Emergency readiness (with vs without buffer): bars or lines showing how long a buffer lasts; short bars mean vulnerability.
- Baseline vs stressed corpus trend: two lines; the stressed line dipping earlier shows how health costs shorten runway.
- Axes: time on the horizontal axis, costs or corpus on the vertical axis. Baseline = normal plan, stressed = with health costs.
- Takeaway: spot the point where the stressed line breaks to see preparedness gaps.

✅ Freemium helps the user realize: health planning is preparedness, not fear.

## Premium Section: Personalized Health Impact Analysis

Premium feels like a concise report: KPI-first, action-ready.

### Premium KPIs (Explained)
- Out-of-Pocket Cost (post-insurance): what you actually pay after coverage.
- Extra corpus required: the additional buffer needed to stay safe.
- Depletion age impact: whether the plan breaks earlier and by how many years.
- Corpus drop at retirement (or at 60/70/80): how much the starting corpus shrinks under health stress.

### Premium Graphs (Explained)
- Corpus depletion: baseline vs with disease; shows survivability gap and break age markers.
- Monthly withdrawal pressure: baseline vs with health costs; shows cash-flow strain each year.
- Why it matters: converts medical risk into clear numbers and visible runway differences.

### Premium Action Plan (What user does next)
- Build a health buffer sized to out-of-pocket costs.
- Cover insurance gaps so shocks don’t force early withdrawals.
- Adjust SIP or reduce withdrawals to restore runway.
