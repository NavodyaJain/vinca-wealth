# Readiness Fit

---

## 1. Feature Purpose

The Readiness Fit assessment aggregates results from three separate calculators (Financial Readiness, Lifestyle Planner, Health Stress Test) into a single comprehensive score that measures how well a user's retirement plan aligns across multiple dimensions: financial sufficiency, lifestyle affordability, and health cost sustainability.

## 2. What Inputs Are Used

**From Financial Readiness Calculator**:
- Whether the plan achieves the target retirement age
- Whether the retirement corpus sustains the full expected lifespan
- The gap between required and current monthly SIP

**From Lifestyle Planner**:
- The target retirement lifestyle tier (Basic, Comfortable, or Premium)
- The retirement lifestyle tier the plan can actually support
- The monthly income gap between desired and achievable withdrawals

**From Health Stress Test**:
- The selected health scenario (everyday, planned, high-impact)
- The impact on retirement corpus duration with health costs included
- The health risk level categorization (low, medium, high)

## 3. How the Score / Number Is Built

### Three-Category Assessment

The score aggregates three independent assessments, each contributing points:

**Category A: Financial Readiness Gap (0–33 points)**
- **33 points**: Plan cannot achieve target retirement age (critical gap)
- **22 points**: Plan reaches target age but cannot sustain full lifespan (moderate gap)
- **11 points**: Plan achieves target age and sustains lifespan (low gap)

**Category B: Lifestyle Gap (0–33 points)**
- **33 points**: Desired retirement lifestyle exceeds what the plan affords (critical gap)
- **22 points**: Plan generates income shortfall for desired lifestyle (moderate gap)
- **11 points**: Plan supports desired lifestyle (low gap)

**Category C: Health Sustainability Gap (0–34 points)**
- **34 points**: Health costs significantly reduce corpus duration or high health risk detected (critical gap)
- **23 points**: Health costs create moderate reduction or uncertainty in corpus longevity (moderate gap)
- **12 points**: Health costs have minimal impact (low gap)

### Total Score Calculation

**Formula**: Sum of all three categories, capped at 100 points
- Minimum: 0 (no gaps across all categories)
- Maximum: 100 (critical gaps in all categories)

### Fit Level Classification

- **80–100 points**: "Strong Fit" — Multiple critical gaps identified across categories
- **50–79 points**: "Moderate Fit" — Some planning gaps present in one or two categories
- **0–49 points**: "Limited Fit" — Plan mostly on track with minimal gaps

## 4. What the Score Means

**High Score (80–100)** — Multiple significant gaps exist across financial, lifestyle, and health dimensions. The plan has multiple areas that need attention or adjustment.

**Medium Score (50–79)** — The plan has gaps in one or two dimensions but is reasonable in others. Some targeted adjustments could improve alignment.

**Low Score (0–49)** — The plan is well-aligned across dimensions. Few gaps suggest the plan is reasonably structured.

**Fit Level** — Communicates the overall readiness status: "Strong Fit" (gaps exist), "Moderate Fit" (some gaps), or "Limited Fit" (minimal gaps). 

*Note*: "Fit" refers to planning alignment, not personal satisfaction or life readiness.

## 5. What the Score Does NOT Mean

- **Does NOT measure life satisfaction** — A low gap score does not guarantee financial confidence or quality of life
- **Does NOT account for user preferences** — The assessment uses standardized categories; does not incorporate personal values or priorities
- **Does NOT provide recommendations** — The score identifies gaps but does not prescribe specific actions
- **Does NOT predict market or life outcomes** — Based on calculator assumptions; does not account for volatility, unexpected events, or behavioral changes
- **Does NOT evaluate plan quality** — A moderate score does not mean the plan is "bad" or "good," only that gaps exist relative to stated goals
- **Does NOT consider inflation for specific lifestyle choices** — Uses general inflation rates; does not model custom expense categories
- **Does NOT track changes over time** — Score is a point-in-time snapshot; does not show improvement/degradation trends
- **Does NOT weight personal priorities** — All three categories (financial, lifestyle, health) are equally weighted regardless of user importance
- **Does NOT evaluate financial advisor quality** — Score is independent of how the plan was constructed

---

## 6. Boundaries & Constraints

- **Depends on three calculators** — Readiness Fit cannot be calculated if Financial Readiness has not been completed; other calculators optional
- **Equal category weighting** — Financial, lifestyle, and health gaps contribute equally (33/33/34 points) regardless of user priority
- **Uses calculator assumptions** — Score inherits all assumptions from component calculators (fixed returns, inflation rates, etc.)
- **No goal-setting** — Cannot set target fit level or track progress toward improved fit
- **Fixed thresholds** — "Strong/Moderate/Limited" boundaries (80/50) are not adjustable
- **No time dimension** — Does not track when gaps originated or how they've evolved
- **Incomplete data handling** — If calculators not completed, assessment is based on available data only (proportionally rescored)
- **Single household model** — Assesses individual or household as a unit; does not differentiate multi-generational planning
- **No insurance integration** — Uses calculator outputs which assume full out-of-pocket costs; insurance optimization not modeled
- **Snapshot, not trend** — Provides current status only; does not show historical fit scores or improvement trajectory
